The software has a considerable focus on making literate programming easy-to-learn and practice for newbies. Therefore, it can be taught to undergraduate students in introductory courses to document code and practice statistical reporting.

The [__`github package`__](https://github.com/haghish/github) can be used to install __MarkDoc__ and all of its dependencies as shown below:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngithub install haghish/markdoc\r\n```\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe major releases of __MarkDoc__ are also hosted on SSC server. However, installing from SSC is not recommended because the SSC package is only updated occasionly on SSC. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nssc install markdoc\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarkDoc also requires 3 third-party software, which are:\r\n\r\n- [__Pandoc__](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)\r\n- [__wkhtmltopdf__](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html)\r\n- [__pdfLaTeX__](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)\r\n\r\nThe __pdfLaTeX__ is optional, but required for generating PDF slides and typesetting documents written in LaTeX. \r\n\r\n\r\nDialog box\r\n----------\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/haghish/MarkDoc/wiki/GUI\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/haghish/MarkDoc/images/gui_markdoc.png\"  width=\"300\" hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"6\"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\nTo further facilitate using __MarkDoc__ in classrooms, a dialog box was written for Stata, which also shows the options and features of MarkDoc. The dialog box supports all three engines of MarkDOc for creating \r\n_dynamic document_, _dynamic presentation slides_, and _package vignette (e.g. Stata help files, package manual, etc)_. \r\n\r\nTo use the dialog box, type:\r\n\r\n    db markdoc\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n  **E.
