Workshop Examples
=================

This document includes some of the examples of the workshop. I have organized 
them in separate do files and the dynamic document will include all of the 
examples. 

Help
----

If you need help about working with __MarkDoc__ package, probably the 
best place to begin is the 
[MarkDoc GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/haghish/MarkDoc/wiki), which is the 
package manual. If you have questions, post them on <www.statalist.org> and I 
get back to you shortly.
